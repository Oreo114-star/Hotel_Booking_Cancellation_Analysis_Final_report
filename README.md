# 📊 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to identify cancellation patterns, pricing trends, and seasonal behavior.  
The goal is to help hotels reduce booking cancellations and improve revenue management through data-driven insights.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
Hotel booking dataset containing information such as:
- Hotel type (City Hotel / Resort Hotel)
- Booking cancellation status
- Average Daily Rate (ADR)
- Reservation status date
- Customer country
- Booking month

## 🔍 Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Visualization of trends and patterns  
5. Insight generation and conclusions  

## 📈 Key Analysis
- Cancellation rate comparison between hotel types  
- ADR trends over time  
- Monthly cancellation behavior  
- Country-wise cancellation distribution  
- Revenue impact due to cancellations  

## 📌 Results & Insights
- City Hotels show higher cancellation rates than Resort Hotels  
- Higher ADR is often linked with higher cancellations  
- Cancellations are strongly seasonal  
- Few countries contribute to the majority of cancellations  
- Peak-season cancellations cause significant revenue loss  

## 🎯 Conclusion
The analysis highlights critical factors influencing hotel booking cancellations. 
Hotels can use these insights to optimize pricing strategies, improve booking policies, 
and minimize revenue loss.
